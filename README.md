# Magic Coding Challenge

This project contains 2 scripts addressing 2 prompts I was asked to complete as part of the 
interview process for [Magic](https://magic.link/)

Each script can be found in the directories [ch_1](ch_1) & [ch_2](ch_2)

#### ch_1
Ths [script](ch_1/flat.py) addresses the following prompt: 
```text
How might you flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. 
A test suite is expected.

- Sample Input: [[1,2,[3]],4]
- Sample Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

#### ch_2

This [script](ch_2/weather.py) addresses these [requirements].
